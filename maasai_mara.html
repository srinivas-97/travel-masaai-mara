    <div class="card" id="overview">
        <img class="center card-img-top" src="https://wallpaperset.com/w/full/3/9/5/175804.jpg" />
        <p class="card-body">November is one of the Best times to visit Kenya, especially to visit its prime park,
            Maasai Mara. This is because the large migratory herds would have returned to Tanzania and now
            the Big cats have to venture long distances to hunt their prey.
            November is also the season of short rains. This makes the plains of Maasai Mara lush green. The
            skies are truly dramatic and colourful. The Sun rise and Sun sets during November at Mara is
            simply breath taking. November is also a time for holidaying and getting together with our families. And the
            icing on the
            cake is we have curated this itinerary for such an affordable costs without compromising on any of
            the services. This is commemorate our first year anniversary of opening up operations at Nairobi.
            Join us on this unforgettable journey of your life time.

            <p>Day 1 - Nov 14th 2023 - Our drivers would pick up from the JKIA airport at 7AM. You would board
                our 4*4 Landcruisers to embark on your journey to Maasai Mara. The road journey takes about 5
                to 6 hours, but you would be amazed by the landscape enroute. You would first see the Nairobi
                national park on your left side. On a lucky day, you would also see a White Rhino grazing near the
                fence. Nairobi city has a national park right in its heart!! And it is home for Lions, Leopards, White
                rhinos, gazzelles, Giraffes, crowned cranes, and other mammals and birds. This is the only city in
                the World which boasts a National park within the city limits.</p>
            <p>After one hour you would climb up to The Great Rift Valley. This is one priced attraction of Kenya.
                Formed a millions years back, this valley boasts beautiful lakes and escarpments, which provide
                havens for plentiful wildlife. The Great Rift Valley runs for 4,000 miles (6,400 kilometers), from
                Jordan in southwestern Asia to the coast of the Indian Ocean in central Mozambique. We suggest
                you request your driver to stop when you are on top and enjoy the views of this Nature’s marvel.
                You would reach Maasai Mara by noon. Complete your check in formalities and proceed to lunch.
                After lunch, you would go on your first game drive on the great plains of Maasai Mara!!.</p>
            <p>This afternoon, our experienced Maasai guides/drivers would take you around the Talek and Topi
                plains area. There you would find a lot of ungulates, antelopes, zebras and also a huge pride of
                Lions. This pride is called the ‘Topi Pride’. Relax, sit back and enjoy God’s creations. You would
                be so excited to see the endless plains of Maasai Mara with its dwellers.
                Return to your camp after 6PM. Refresh yourself and head towards the camp fire. Meet up with
                your group and listen to their first day experience at Mara. Share your magical experiences with
                them. Have dinner and retire for the day ( LD ).</p>

        <p class="card-body">Day 2 - Nov 15th - Wake up early. Freshen yourself and head to the restaurant for a
            hot cup of coffee or tea. The mornings are cold at Mara, so do wear your fleece jacket
            for the morning game drive. Breakfast would be packed for you. Explore the mornings
            at Mara. The Sunrise you witness at Mara is something which you would never get to witness
            anywhere in the World. Just pray that it does not rain!! Our guides would park the vehicle under a tree for
            you to have a bush breakfast. This is an out of
            the World experience. At a distance you can see the animals peacefully grazing while you are
            enjoying your food. Post your breakfast, proceed again on the game drive. Mid mornings while the
            Lions sleep is a good time to look around for the cheetahs. November is also the season when the
            Topis give birth to young ones. On a lucky day, you might witness a Topi giving birth to a little one.
            Keep a watch on the hyenas as they would always be around a pregnant Topi!.</p>

        <p class="card-body">Day 3 - Nov 16th - Today is a very busy day for you at Mara. Wake up early, freshen
            yourself,
            have a hot beverage and jump into your designated vehicles. Today you would be going towards
            the border of Maasai Mara. You would be going for a full day game drive with packed breakfast. and lunch.
            Sand river is the border for Maasai Mara and Tanzania. This has been the entry point of the
            migratory animals for millions of years. You would be amazed to see such a small river separates
            two different countries!! Enjoy every bit your time as this is your last day of game drive for this trip.
            Have lunch and take a small nap like our Maasai guides. Then proceed towards your camp. On the
            way back encounter a pride of lion. During your stay at Mara, you would have seen the Big 4 our of
            the Big 5. The Rhino being very elusive is going to be a difficult find. But this area is know for the
            Rhinos. If you are lucky you would get to see one.

            Return to the camp with great memories. Spend you evening at the camp fire before having dinner.
            Retire for the day.
            Sadly the holiday has come to an end. But at the end you would release that it was the journey
            which was so beautiful. Have a blissful night. ( BLD )</p>
